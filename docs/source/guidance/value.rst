======================

Requests is an open but opinionated library, created by an open but opinionated developer.


价值
----

- 简单为上 Simplicity is always better than functionality.
- Listen to everyone, then disregard it.
- The API is all that matters. Everything else is secondary.
- Fit the 90% use-case. Ignore the nay-sayers.

标准库?

Requests has no *active* plans to be included in the standard library. This decision has been discussed at length with Guido as well as numerous core developers.

.. raw:: html

    <script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="68f22f0841734d848315c618111b13ea" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

Essentially, the standard library is where a library goes to die. It is appropriate for a module to be included when active development is no longer necessary.
